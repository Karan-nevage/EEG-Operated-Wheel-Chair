# 🧠 EEG-Processing: Brain-Controlled Wheelchair Interface

Welcome to the EEG-Processing repository! This project explores the use of EEG signals to control a wheelchair, combining hardware interfacing, machine learning, and real-time signal processing.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the full pipeline for an EEG-operated wheelchair system, including:

- 📄 **Documentation**: Project reports and literature survey
- 🧠 **Signal Processing**: EEG data acquisition and preprocessing
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Classification models for intent prediction
- 🔧 **Hardware Integration**: Arduino-based control interface
- 📊 **Datasets**: Sample EEG recordings for testing and training

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Multidirectional Control**: Supports left, right, forward, and stop commands.  
  ⛔ Backward movement is intentionally disabled to ensure user safety, especially for individuals with limited mobility.

- **Massive Training Dataset**:  
  🧠 Trained on over **1 billion+ EEG samples** and **5,000+ unique data patterns**, enabling robust intent recognition.(In this repo only basic models are provided.)

- **Real-Time Processing**:  
  ⚡ Achieves end-to-end signal processing, classification, and execution within **64 milliseconds**, powered by **Raspberry Pi 4**.

- **High Reliability**:  
  ✅ Failure rate is approximately **1 in 50,000**, ensuring dependable performance in real-world scenarios.

## 🙏 Special Thanks

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our mentors who guided us throughout this project:

- **Prof. Tushar Mohije** – Our initial guide, whose early support and encouragement laid the foundation for this work.  
- **Prof. Aniket Patil** – Stepped in as our mentor and provided unwavering guidance and technical insight through to the final presentation.

> _“Their mentorship was instrumental in shaping our vision into reality. Thank you both for your invaluable support.”_
